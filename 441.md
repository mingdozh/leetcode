# Problem
[Arranging Coins](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins)
# Solution
Solution is straight forward.  Let's define i as row number and n as coin number.  
We do the follwing steps until i is larger than n:  
1. increase result by 1
2. decrease n by i
3. increase i by 1

```
public class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++) {
            result++;
            n-=i;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
