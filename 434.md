public class Solution {
    public int countSegments(String s) {
        int result = 0;
        boolean flag=false;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if(!flag) {
                if(c!=' ') {
                    result++;
                    flag=true;
                }
            }else{
                if(c==' ')   flag = false;
            }
