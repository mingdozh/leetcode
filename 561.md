# Problem
[Array Partition I](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i/)

# Solution
The key to solve this problem is how we group given integers into pairs. Obviously, the smallest integer will be   
added to the result. Which integer should be paired with the smallest integer? The second smallest integer.  
If the smallest two integers are not grouped in one pair, both of them will be added to the result and   
the result could not be the largest. Repeatly, all integers in odd position of the sorted array will be added to result.

```
public class Solution {
    public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums,0,nums.length);
        
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i+=2)
            sum+=nums[i];
            
        return sum;
        
    }
}
```
