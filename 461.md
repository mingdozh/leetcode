# Problem

[Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/#/description)

# Solution

The solution is to find how many bits are different between two integers, x and y.  

If we do an XOR operation between x and y, 1 bits of the result are the bits different between x and y.   

So we can count one bit number of x^y.

```
public class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        return countOnes(x^y);
    }
    
    private int countOnes(int n) {
        int r = 0;
        while(n!=0) {
            r++;
            n = n & (n-1);
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```
